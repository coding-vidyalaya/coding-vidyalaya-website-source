                    <p>Being Computer Engineers, we (Founders of Coding Vidyalaya) used to feel very happy reading articles like <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2502348/it-management/it-jobs-will-grow-22--through-2020--says-u-s-.html">this,</a> which states that jobs in IT sector are not just on the rise, they are on a rising spree. Almost everyone would agree that IT sector is the hottest sector when it comes to placement opportunities. But, it wasn't very late that we realised that this is just half the story.</p>
                    <p>Our happiness were washed away by <a href="http://www.aspiringminds.in/docs/national_employability_study_IT_aspiringminds.pdf">a survey</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiring_Minds">Aspiring Minds</a> which states in <a href="http://www.aspiringminds.in/researchcell/articles/why_are_indian_engineers_unemployable.html">their article</a> that more than 80% of Indian Engineering graduates are unemployable. We were shocked at the conclusion of this survey. It was tough to believe, but we found similar articles everywhere, including <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-04-07/news/29392668_1_engineering-colleges-employability-study-nasscom">this</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economic_Times">The Economic Times.</a></p>
                    <p>Indian students are respected all over the world for their hard working attitude. Then, why are they termed unemployable after doing B.Tech/BCA/MCA? There are a lot of factors. If we start pointing out, a lot of blame game will happen. So, instead of blaming, we took it on ourselves to generate employable talents. Its our responsibility to train students on latest technologies being used in the field of IT as per Industry Standards. We are starting with the hottest technologies on the planet i.e. "Node.JS" and "React.JS".</p>
