                    <p>Working with new tools and techniques, we have realised that real life work is quite different from what we are taught in academics. There is a huge gap between academic world and the real world.</p>
                    <p>Whatever they teach in academics is very important, as they lay the foundation of an engineering mindframe. Without these academic fundamentals, it is tough to grow as an engineer. But, they are too generic for any specific problem.</p>

                    <h2 class="intro-text text-center">Evolving Nature of Computer Science field</h2>
                    <p>Real life problems cannot be solved by applying just the academic principles learnt in college. These problems and their solutions are evolving very rapidly. In the field of computer science, if you don't learn new things continuosly, you become outdated. Everyday, new hacks are found. And everyday, those hacks are patched. Everyday, new challenges are coming, and everyday, a better solution to those solutions are proposed. Computer Science is a branch of continuous evolution and continuous learning.</p>

                    <h2 class="intro-text text-center">Synchronization with Industry</h2>
                    <p>Moreover, synchronisation with Industry is equally important. Placements in poorly ranked colleges of Bangalore and Delhi region is better than colleges of other cities with better facilities and better ranking. Synchronisation, in a way, help us to know new things happening in the industry.</p>

                    <h2 class="intro-text text-center">Why this seminar.</h2>
                    <p>Indian students are respected all over the world for their aptitude and hard work. Yet, we rarely see an Indian student starting up a new company. Indians are known as problem solvers. Throw any problem at an Indian, and you will get a solid jugaad to solve that problem. We have the idea, but we don't have the technology to put that idea into action.</p>
                    <p>We, at Coding Vidyalaya, want to solve this problem. We are making students aware of the latest technologies being used in software Industry. We are organising seminars for computer science students so that they get in tune with the latest in the industry. So that they can put their idea into action.</p>
